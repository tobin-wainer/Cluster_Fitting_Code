# Cluster_Fitting_Code
Here are my verions of code origionally developed By Aaron Geller at Northwestern for my REU. 

The primary functionality is to do a Gaia area search and determine which stars are cluster members, and then fitting an isochrone. The is the Gaia_membership_tutorial notebook. Most useful in this notebook is the GaiaClusterMembers class, which is also written uniquely into Cluster_Memberships.py 

The isochrone fitting code is easily applicable to Gaia even though the filters are Not Gaia.
